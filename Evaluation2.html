                    <h4>Summary of Achievements</h4>
                    <p>
                        Over the past 6 months, we managed to successfully implement all of the “must have” requirements as well as the “should have” ones. We unfortunately only completed 1 of the 2 “could have” functionalities due to time constraints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The feature we were unable to implement is the following:” The chatbot is conversational and user can interact with it in a natural human-like way”. If this feature were implemented, the bot could have been able to have dialogs with the user by remembering what the user had previously said.
                    </p>

                    <h4>A List of Known Bugs</h4>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the bugs, we have spotted that our bot has a tautology problem on only one type of question. Sometimes, when the bot is asked a question about the energy price which included date and time, it does not extract the date entity and asks the user to input it once again. We believe this is due to the fact that the bot is struggling to understand if a number (for example 18) is the day of the month or 18 o’clock. We trained the bot more to make it distinguish between the hour and day of the month, but there are still times when it is faulty.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Critical evaluation of the project</h4>
                    <h5>
                        User interface/User experience (if applicable)
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        We believe that our bot will have a great impact on the users of Renewables.AI once the bot will be integrated in the online platform. Our main focus was to make the bot able to use a concise and simple vocabulary so that any user could use it without encountering any language difficulties. Moreover, the bot will respond to any question and it will inform the user if it cannot understand the question or if it needs additional information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also important to note that the bot will be the first thing on the web app that interacts with the user, which will in turn trigger their curiosity and perhaps even start using it without exactly knowing what it does. When the users start to understand what the bot can do for them, they could be inclined to come back for future conversations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, having this chat bot on the platform will likely increase the average session length of the users on the platform. The bot could be very helpful for the users who want to quickly find out a specific piece of information because the user would not be required to browse through the platform to find it. Moreover, the bot’s ability to display graphs gives the user a clear insight into their plant’s performance data by showing trends and other important statistics.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Functionality
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Both of the project’s components are functional, both being ready to be incorporated within the Renewables.AI platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bot shows an almost perfect performance, by being able to understand the users’ requests and responding to them accordingly. The bot is thus not only able to ask questions whenever it does not recognise the request, but it can also access the database to get the right data and display it in a meaningful manner to the the user. The conversation between the bot and the user cannot yet be fully categorized as natural, human-like conversation since the chatbot’s main purpose is to aid the user with information. This component performs well as we conducted the performance and stress tests.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Maintainability
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the maintenance cost for the bot, we calculated the approximate cost of keeping the chatbot and the “Renewables.AI” webapp running on Azure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the chatbot, we found out that the owners of Renewables.AI would have to spend approximately 250 pounds per month by choosing the standard package in order to deliver a responsive chatbot to the public.This package includes unlimited messages and hosting on Azure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, in order to host the webapp on Azure, making sure that the confidential data is secured and that the application runs effectively, the owners would be required to spend approximately 550 pounds per month. That would include 250GB of data storage for the user data as well as solar energy information such as the data received from the DarkSky API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The total maintenance costs would be low for the owners since it is a profitable application and numerous solar farm owners would invest in this application in order to help their businesses grow.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Project Management
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Our team managed to deliver the key requirements of the project on time to our clients. We used the Agile Methodology focusing on team collaboration and emphasizing incremental delivery.  We used Messenger as a communication channel where we would update each other on the current status of our tasks, as well as to ask for help whenever needed. We also had a common Google Drive folder where we held important documents such as bi-weekly reports,  project diagrams or video scripts. We also had a Microsoft Teams channel with our clients where we set up Skype or personal meetings alongside uploaded documents and reports regarding our work. We used Github as a version control hosting service, where we kept our code in private repositories.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Future Work
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Supposing we had another 3 more months to work on our project, one of our main tasks would be to make the Data Science part and Chatbot System integration. We could also try to implement the last “could have” requirement : ” The chatbot is conversational and user can interact with it in a natural human-like way”.  We could have implemented this feature by focusing on the language understanding aspect as well as making it keep track of the past questions that had been asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that one possible future improvement for this project is to extend it on to other renewable energy sources such as hydro energy or wind power. That would be a great success for both Renewables.AI as well as the business owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One other improvement would be to come up with a more precise Data Science algorithm. A more precise algorithm means delivering a better service to the users of Renewables.AI. Furthermore, as more data is accumulated and new algorithms with better performance appear on the market, failing to update the Data Science algorithm would make Renewables.AI at one point out of date. That is one issue the owners of this project should take into account in the future.
                    </p>
