									<p>After we have created the personas, we got an general idea of why and how the user will use our appplication. We came up with a scenario which summerize well the interaction between the user and our web. </p>
									<h4>Renewables.ai scenario</h4>
									<p> Mark is a 30- year old entrepreneur who has just started his own business. His company is a local energy provider. After a thorough research, he reached the conclusion that green energy is more profitable on the long term. Because the companyâ€™s quarter is located in Eastbourne, he thought about taking advantage of the geographical potential of the area and built a solar power plant. Being new on the market and without any previous experience in solar energy, he turned to Renewables.AI platform. Mark can log into his account and can visualize a personalized view of the data received from the panels. He now has a good estimation of how much energy the panels are going to produce each day, as well as a precise prediction of how much revenue he can make daily. This gives him a good feedback on how well his company is performing and helps him make decision for the long term. Despite him not having any previous experience with solar energy, he is able to stay a valid competitor on the market.</p>
