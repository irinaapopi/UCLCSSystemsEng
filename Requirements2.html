                    <h4>Project Background and Client</h4>
                    <h5>Our CLient</h5>
                        <p>
                            Elastacloud Limited has been a long-standing Microsoft Azure partner with specialisms in data science, data engineering and cloud. Elastacloud has had countless successes with customers over the years with some of the most challenging Azure and data-related projects for customers such as Asos, Marks and Spencers, JustGiving, IOI amongst many others.

                        </p>
                    <h5>Project Background</h5>
                        <p>
                            Elastacloud has teamed up with the largest asset manager of solar farms in Europe, Quintas Energy. In this joint venture, both companies are committed to building a data science platform, called Renewables.ai, to manage the lifecycle of solar farms from engineering to trading predictions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Renewables.ai, as a platform, will be used to predict near-real time output of solar energy farms. In this instance predictions based on combinations of model building and anomaly detection will enable the solar farm managers to respond better and build better component inventories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to understanding the output, renewables.ai will provide decision support for energy traders and brokers that want to trade out their energy on the half-hourly market by understanding the production shortfalls, energy market movements and undersupply and oversupplies against power purchase agreements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Renewables.ai will also focus on better data strategies and ensure that data from the plant is as real-time as possible with IoT and streaming technologies being used in ingest data into Microsoft Azure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some key technical challenges are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Using the newest techniques in Deep Learning to make better predictions by enriching data from the weather
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        We have two main broad project goals. First, to build a conversational chatbot that can interact with the Renewables.ai data science platform to provide insightful responses to questions users ask it and thus enhancing the user experience (UX) of the platform. Second, to improve the prediction model used to predict the energy output of solar energy farms.

                    <h4>Requirement gathering</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our requirements were gathered by having several face-to-face meetings with our client where we discussed the scope of the project and negotiated a set of MoSCoW requirements. The requirements were subsequently refined and disambiguated by having a number of video calls and Slack conversations with our client.
