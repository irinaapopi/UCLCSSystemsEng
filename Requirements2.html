                    <h4>Project Background and Client</h4>
                    <p>Elastacloud Limited are a Data Science Consultancy that specializes in Data Science and its practical applications in the Business world.
                        Renewables AI is a subdivision of Elastacloud that is currently developing a specialized product for the solar industry, and more specifically for people that are directly or indirectly involved with the production of solar energy and the revenue it generates.
                        During the project, we were in contact with Allan Mitchell, Laura Da Silva (head of of the Data Science Division) and Bianca Furtuna (Data Science).
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>The way the application is currently working is as follows: the client logs into his/her personal account that shows the solar plants under his/her management and he/she can visualize a personalized view of the revenue the plants are generating on a daily basis. The application is thus using Microsoft Azure Services, data from the Dark Sky API, data from the plant/s and machine learning to predict the revenue of the solar plants up to 48 hours in advance.</p>

                    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        As the application is still in its early stages, there are some limitations that affect its prediction accuracy (Random Forest Algorithm is being used that only has an accuracy of up to 80%). As a result, our clients needed a new better algorithm that could be used to predict the solar energy production based on the irradiance forecast. Our team’s first task was thus to address this problem by researching and implementing an additional machine learning model that could be used to accurately predict the energy production.

                    <p>
                        Moreover, our clients underlined the need of having a form of active interaction between the software and the users. Our team’s second task was to integrate a chatbot into their platform that would help the user with gathering quick data about their plants as well as helping them navigate through the platform.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Requirement gathering</h4>
                    <p>
                        On our first meeting with our client, we got to know the company as well as their requirements for the project. We arranged the timeline of the project as well as talked about which features will be prioritized during the development.
                        As a result, we agreed on a set of MOSCOW requirements with our client. The highest priority requirements are: to implement a chatbot, improve the accuracy of energy generated predictions, implement energy price predictions, and implement plant performance prediction.

                        While planning the design of our project, we created some user personas that would reflect some typical user profiles.
