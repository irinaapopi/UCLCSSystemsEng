                    <h4>Early stages</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the early weeks of our project, we focused in researching potential frameworks for the Chatbot and algorithms for the Data Science prediction algorithm. After consulting a variety of online resources, we had to choose which technologies to use.

                    <h4>Chatbot Technologies</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the chatbot we considered : Microsoft Bot Framework, Botkit, Alaas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Microsoft Bot Framework</b> is one of the most famous frameworks used worldwide to create bots. The bot Framework is a standard Azure web application and enables the user to create a bot easily and quickly with either Node.JS or C#. The bot can be developed and debugged locally with the Bot Builder SDK. One important feature is that being an Azure web application, there is an option of continuous deployment. That means that any changes in the code that is to the source control (for example GitHub) is then automatically deployed on Azure. The most important feature of the Microsoft Bot Framework is that it uses LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service). LUIS is a Machine learning-based service that helps build natural language understanding into the chatbot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>BotKit</b> is one other tool used to build chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit is an open source toolkit from Howdy and can integrate bots in messaging platforms such as Slack. Each Botkit bot is actually a Node.js app, made up of the Botkit core library, a basic web server, and the application logic and plugins. One interesting feature of this chatbot framework is that can respond to non-verbal events as well like when a file gets uploaded, or a button gets clicked. These events are handled using an event handling pattern that should look familiar to most developers. Furthermore, most events in Botkit can be replied to like normal messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last chatbot framework we took into account is <b>Alaas</b> (chatbots.io). Alaas is based on the Pandorabots API. This API supports an open standard scripting language called Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML), which is also XML-based.  The Pandorabots helps integrate the Alaas bot, hosting service and natural language processing engine into the creatorâ€™s own application. The bot can be programmed using Java, Node.JS or Python. In contrast to the other bots, you must purchase a plan in order to start coding your bot. The cheapest plan is the Developer one for $9 / month and includes the possibility to create up to 10 bots with 10 000 interactions.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        For the chatbot, we chose to go with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Since our clients mainly work with Microsoft products, they preferred us to use this framework since it could be compatible with all of their products.  Furthermore,  since one of our requirements was to make the chatbot able to hold a natural conversation with the user, the LUIS feature of the Azure framework seemed the most suitable for our project.
