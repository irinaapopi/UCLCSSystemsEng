                    <h4>Testing Techniques used</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to spot the errors and flaws of our application, we carried out tests during the development process. More detailed tests were done for the bot since it was a more complex component.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Functional Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Functional testing involves testing weather a software product is providing the desired output as desired by the end-user or business. It involves evaluating and comparing each function of the software with the business requirements. The testing is done using some relevant input and evaluating the output generated. Functional testing also checks the usability of the application such as ensuring that the navigational functions work as the business requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One example of functional testing is “Black box testing”. This technique tests the software without looking at the internal code structure, implementation details and is based entirely on the software requirements and specifications. Usually, these are the steps of Black Box testing:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Examine the requirements and specifications of the system
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose relevant inputs to check if the system processes them correctly
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Determine the expected outputs generated by the input
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Conduct the tests
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Compare the actual outputs with the expected outputs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Detect if there are any bugs and re-test the system
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        During the development of the chatbot, we used the “Black box testing” technique in order to see if the chabot replies with the right answer for the user’s questions. This testing method was by far the most used and very efficient during the development of our project. Firstly, we sketched the questions the user might ask the bot and generated the desired answer the bot should output. We then tested these questions on the emulator and spotted possible errors of the bot. After observing the flaws, we would try to solve it and then test the new features afterwards. Some of the most errors we spot using the “Black box testing” were related to tautology: sometimes the bot could not recognize entities (in our case plant names). In order to solve this issue, we had to think of more relevant intents to help the bot find where the plant name lies generally in the sentence structure.

                    <h4>System Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        “System testing “tests the behavior of the whole system as defined by the scope of the project. It tests both functional and non-functional requirements of the testing. It is usually the final test the verify if the whole system meets the all specifications and the requirements. To test a system, requirements and expectations should be clear from the beginning. System testing usually involves:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            testing fully integrated applications by checking if all the components of the system interact well with one another and with the system as a whole
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            verify through testing every input to see if it generates the desired output
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            test the user experience of the application
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For out bot, we did system testing by seeing if the bot interacts with the LUIS platform as well as with the database. That means that the bot should recognize entities and intents using LUIS, gather data from the database by executing a SQL query specific to every type of intent, and output the desired answer to the user. Thus, we tried to simulate a conversation between a real user and the bot and see if the flow of the conversation is natural. As a result, the bot was triggered by a list of questions which were asked sequentially.

                    <h4>Stress Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        “Stress testing” is a form of intense testing used to determine the stability of the system. This is done by testing beyond the normal capacity of the system by reaching a potential break point. It is usually used to detect the safe usage limits, modes of failure, to confirm that the specifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We wanted to see if our bot can handle many requests for the user and therefore conducted a stress testing. This was done by sending 20 requests per second for 5 seconds. Ideally, the system should have responded with 100 correct responses within 5 seconds. This test was conducted and was indeed successful, concluding that the bot can cope with multiple requests from the users.

                    <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        “Performance testing” is the process of determining the speed or effectiveness of a system and can be done by measuring the response time and is usually done in conjunction with stress testing.  A bag system which fail a performance test might have one or more of the following characteristics:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            long time to load:  this is the initial time it takes for an application to load and ideally it should be kept to minimum
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            poor response time: it is the time that the system takes to process the input and generate the output; generally, the system must be quick so that the user does not wait long and does not lose interest
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            bottlenecking: these are obstacles that make the overall system performance degrade over time. This can be caused by faulty bits of code and can be fixed by finding and modifying the bug in the code. Some examples of bottlenecking are memory utilization, CPU utilization or operating system limitation
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We used the performance testing in order to see whether the bot is quick to respond to the user. As stated above, our stress test involved checking if the bot outputs the answers quickly to the user. As the stress test passed, that means that the bot did not struggled to respond immediately even though there were numerous requests per second. Furthermore, the Azure Portal has a feature called “Performance test” that allows the developers to monitor the efficiency of their application.

                    <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest parts of an application are called units and are individually analyzed to see if they produce the right output. It is a meticulous approach to building a system and involves testing the characteristics which are vital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While developing our bot, we felt that we have to use the unit test to verify the LUIS API. Unit testing could not be done by checking each function of the bot since each function needed to interact to both the database and the LUIS API and this test would have fallen under “functional testing”. As a result, the smallest unit we could test was testing the LUIS API. The unit test involved reviewing if the API respond quickly to the requests and if it responds correctly to them.

                    <h4>Acceptance Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. This test is executed against the test data and then the results are compared with the expected ones and are done at the end of the development of the system. The acceptance criteria are defined based on some of the following attributes: functionality correctness and completeness, data integrity, usability, performance or scalability. The acceptance test is designed to reach one the following conclusions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Accept the system delivered
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Accept the system after some requested modifications are made
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not accept the system
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In order to perform all the tests, we needed some input questions. For our bot, we firstly sketched some example questions a user might ask, which were approved by our clients. Based on those, we wrote the intents for the bot and gradually tested against those inputs. Some examples of questions could be: “what is the top performing plant by energy production”, “how much revenue did the plants in surrey make on 17th January?” or “tell me the plants in my portfolio “.
