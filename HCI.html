                    <h4>Gathering User Data</h4>
                    <p>Before our team started designing the prototypes for the Chatbot and the Data Science part, we decided to conduct some research by asking some of our colleagues to answer some survey questions.
                        They were asked questions about User Interface and Chatbot features that they would like to see implemented. (the proportions on the charts are in percentages %)</p>

                    <h4>Scenario</h4>
                    <p>After we have created the personas, we got an general idea of why and how the user will use our appplication. We came up with a scenario which summerize well the interaction between the user and our web. </p>
                    <h5>Renewables.ai scenario</h5>
                    <p> Mark is a 30 year old entrepreneur who has just started his own business. His company is a local energy provider. After a thorough research, he reached the conclusion that green energy is more profitable on the long term. Because the company’s quarter is located in Eastbourne, he thought about taking advantage of the geographical potential of the area and built a solar power plant. Being new on the market and without any previous experience in solar energy, he turned to Renewables.AI platform. Mark can log into his account and can visualize a personalized view of the data received from the panels. He now has a good estimation of how much energy the panels are going to produce each day, as well as a precise prediction of how much revenue he can make daily. This gives him a good feedback on how well his company is performing and helps him make decision for the long term. When he wants to see quick information such as the weather forest for the next 7 days or a summary of the plant info, he interacts with the chat box integrated in the user interface. Moreover, whenever Mark needs guidance on how to interact with the graphs, the chat box will explain him to do it.  Despite him not having any previous experience with solar energy, he is able to stay a valid competitor in the market.</p>

                    <h4>Data Science Prototype</h4>
                    <p> We used the library Chart.js to implement the interactive Prototype of the graph. The user can now click the "Add Actual Production" or the "Remove Actual Production" buttons to
                        show or hide the Actual Production line and the "1 hour" button to show the Revenue and Price Prediction for the next hour. For now, just this
                        button is implemented and can be clicked multiple times to show a further prediction. Nevertheless, the current prediction lines are plotted
                        using randomized data, which is due to be replaced with a proper dataset at a later stage of the project. One of the main aims is to also improve
                        the accuracy of the prediction lines using machine learning algorithms.</p>

                    <h4>Bot Prototype</h4>

                    <p>After conducting some research into how chatbots work and what techniques can be used to build rich and capable bots, our
                        team started to sketch some straightforward interactions with the so called "Elastabot. As, we discovered that we can implement the
                        ability to send or receive attachments, ask the bot for more information by pressing the relevant buttons or by asking direct questions,
                        we began by drawing some basic conversations. We are aiming to later implement the bot to using LUIS(Natural Language Understanding Software) so that it could make relevant
                        suggestions based on the conversation with the user.</p>

                        <p><span class="image left"><a class='botsoc' href='https://app.botsociety.io/emb/59efb55d7844dd0f0098a26b?p=afe77945cde550176ac62eb43b802cd88e0ad2aa' target='medium'></a></span>
                            In order to create an interactive version of the Elastabot, we chose to use the tools provided by the Botsociety. Botsociety offers an online
                            platform that can be used to create interactive chatbot prototypes that can be shared with other users. As we wanted our bot to be able to
                            interact in a number of different ways, Elastabot can not only offer "button" alternatives, but also understand regular questions and
                            browse the Internet for information. It can answer questions related to the plant/s owned by the user, user interface navigation and even topics
                            such as weather forecast and/or solar energy. The bot is currently only set to ask a series of standard questions after it finishes answering the user's initial question, such as "Is there anything else I could help you with?". Our team is aiming to create an interactive chatbot using machine learning algorithms that will be able to hold a fluent conversation and even make suggestionsbased on the conversation with the user.

                    <h4>Prototypes Evaluation</h4>
                    <p> In order to evaluate our prototypes, we used the Heuristic Evaluation as well as user testing.</p>
                    <p> Our main goal was to come up with user-friendly features that enabled users to get all kind of information, from the prediction line on the graph to a quick presentation on how to use Renewables.AI with the help of our chatbox.</p>
                    <p>After the finishing the first ptotoype, we saw some flaws which we later fixed, as they are presented in the Heuristic Evaluation  </p>
